  <h1>Shubh Mishra</h1>
  <p><em>Student at <strong>Modern Academy</strong><br /> And a student of coding</em></p>
  <p> I am a Ist year student at <strong>Modern Academy</strong> and I 💖 coding.
    In school learn 👨‍💻java and online I learn‍ Web Development. I want to become a
    <em><strong>software engineer</strong> </em>and want to master all its fields.
    <br>
    I didn't knew the 'c' of coding before the LockDown but during the LockDown I spent
    most of my time on my 💻 and while discovering <i>new features, Tips and Tricks</i>
    about <strong> Windows 10 </strong>, I entered into the world of softwares and coding
    and from there my Journey for Coding began. Therefore, I would like to give some credit
    to 💀Covid-19 💀 as well due to which the LockDown came into existence and I got some
    extra time apart from studying. If it hadn't been for the LockDown I would have
    followed my regular routine of "BreakFast -> School -> Lunch -> Study -> Tennis ->
    Snacks -> Study -> Dinner -> Sleep " .So that has been my 10-step routine and
    I had been following that since past 3 years. I would have followed the same and would probably have not got time to spend with
    💻 and you would be doing other work right now.<br>
    I have opted for Maths with Computer Applications. I want to be selected in
    IIT and I have started preparing for it. From there I want to do B.Tech. I
    want to get selected in IIT but I won't be sad if I am not selected.
